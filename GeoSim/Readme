30-Dec-21 Simulate motion and a magnetic field for multistatic processing. 
Basic idea - All cell phones have magnetometers in them. Is it possible to get them to use their GPS data in conjunction with the magnetometer data and
do some sort of multistatic processing to produce a map. This came about during walks I have had with my daughter.
