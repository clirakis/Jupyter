This value (Wn) is a number between 0 and 1 representing the fraction of the Nyquist frequency to use for the filter. Note that Nyquist frequency is half of the sample rate. As this fraction increases, the cutoff frequency increases. You can get fancy and express this value as 2 * Hz / sample rate."
